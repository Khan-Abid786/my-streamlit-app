<h2>This project is about pridicting wine model</h2>
<p>
  In this project  i have used some of the techniques that i have learned i,e <b>
    Outlier Handling(Zscore)
    Performed EDA(univariate and bivariate analysis)
    Scaling(tried  StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, RobustScaler): model best fitted on MinMaxScaler
    Performed PCA
    Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchcv
  
  </b>
  Tried to train model using : LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier, SVM,RandomForestClassifier,but <b>LogisticRegression</b> performed slightly better than other model especially SVM
